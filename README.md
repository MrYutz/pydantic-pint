# Pydantic Pint

---

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) is a Python library for data validation and data serialization.
[Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io) is a Python library for defining, operating, and manipulating physical quantities.
By default, they do not play well with each other.

Many projects that have a need for data validation may also need to work with physical quantities.
[Pydantic Pint](https://pydantic-pint.readthedocs.io) aims to bridge that gap by providing Pydantic validation for Pint quantities.
